The goals / steps of this project are the following: * Load the data set
(see below for links to the project data set) * Explore, summarize and
visualize the data set * Design, train and test a model architecture *
Use the model to make predictions on new images * Analyze the softmax
probabilities of the new images * Summarize the results with a written
report

  The size of training set is 34799
\item
  The size of the validation set is 4410

  The shape of a traffic sign image is (32,32,3)

I split the data using train\_test\_split() from
sklearn.model\_selection library. I have choosen 20\% as test\_size.\\
Then,I normalized the image data because I want the image data to be in
the range from 0 to 1. I have used ImageDataGenerator from
Keras.preprocessing.image library to preprocess the data and augment it
in real time. My ImageDataGenerator() argument values are given below

I have used Keras.Sequential to design my model architecture. Sequential
is a keras container fot linear stack of layers. Layers will do
automatic shape inference expect the first layer, In the first layer I
have provided the input shape as (32,32,3).

I have designed a model with 6 convolutional layers and a fully
connected layer. I have added one dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
My output contains a softmax activation function to return the
probabilties.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}

\end{longtable}

To train the model, I have used `categorical\_crossentropy' as my loss
fucntion, `stochastic gradient descent(SGD)' as optimizer and metric is
`accuracy' and compiled the model using keras model.compile().

While Training the model I have generated more data on the fly by keras
preprocessing techniques. I have used LearningRateScheduler from
keras.callbacks library to select decaying learning rate over the
epochs. I have used below function to decay the learning over the
epochs. def learning\_rate(epoch): return 0.001*(0.1**int(epoch/10))

I have trained the model using below function in keras

model.fit\_generator(datagen.flow(X\_train,y\_train,batch\_size=batch\_size),steps\_per\_epoch=1500,epochs=epochs,validation\_data=(X\_validation,y\_validation)
, callbacks={[}LearningRateScheduler(lr\_schedule),
ModelCheckpoint(`model.h5',save\_best\_only=True){]})

Hyper parameters used in the model are given below

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
HyperParameter & Value\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Epochs & 10\tabularnewline

\end{longtable}

First, my parameters are like- Constant learning rate=0.001,
epochs=30,batch\_size=32,
steps\_per\_epoch=X\_train.shape{[}0{]}//batch\_size, and I had 3
dropout layers in my CNN. With this setup I have got a validation
accuracy of 90.65\%.

Later, I used decaying learning rate, epochs=10, batch\_size=64, and
removed two dropout layers, My validation accuarcy was 94.87\%

When I set the steps\_per\_epoch=X\_train.shape{[}0{]} and It took a lot
of time to train the model.

After trying different values for parameters, finally I have used
decaying learning rate, epochs=10, Batch\_size=32,
steps\_per\_epoch=1500, I have got a validation accuracy of 98.38\%

My final model results were: * training set accuracy of 95.00\% *
validation set accuracy of 98.38\%

Here are six German traffic signs that I found on the web:

\includegraphics{./test_image/Traffic.png}
\includegraphics{./test_image/tiltedSTOP.jpg}
\includegraphics{./test_image/Rw1.jpg}

The first four images are colored opaque images so I converted them to 3
channel(RGB) images. The last two images might be difficult to classify
because the STOP sign is tilted at angle when it is resized to (32,32)
it has become more noisy, And the Road work sign in not clear and also
tilted.

Since I have added more image data by preprocessing the images while
trianing my model is able to identify thes images correctly. Without
data augmentation It may be difficult to identify the signs in these two
images.
